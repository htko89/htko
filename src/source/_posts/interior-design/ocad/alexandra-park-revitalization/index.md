# Student Project - OCAD
Alexandra Park is a neighbourhood located in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Once battered by crime and violence, Alexandra Park is recovering from its past. David Suzuki Foundation, a NGO, is looking to increase awareness of their cause through their donation & a purchased portion of Alexandra Park.

## Project Criteria:
* A vibrant marketplace “hub” for residents, vendors and events.
* NGO mission statement to reflect in the function and design.
* Flexible natural use of the space and light, and allow for variety of vendors.
* Sustainable, natural renewable materials to showcase balance of nature, diversity and human use.
