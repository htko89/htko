# Personal Project - OCAD Prospective Student Porfolio
"Alfred Wong" is known for his philanthropist work in the art sector. With his companyâ€™s design expertise, "Alfred" wishes to pursue his personal interest in modern design. He is particularly interested in the minimalist style of design. Recently, he acquired 3 famous sculptures and though simple in nature, "Alfred" admires the elegance of these sculptures and wishes to increase public interest via his own personal gallery.

## Personal Note:
This sculpture gallery project is created as one of the pieces in the OCAD Prospective Student Portfolio. It was the amalgamation of the best knowledge and skills I had the time.

## Project Criteria:
* Personal sculpture gallery to reflect and display 3 sculptures to guests.
* Gallery also serves as personal residential space and is built in harmony with nature and landscape.
