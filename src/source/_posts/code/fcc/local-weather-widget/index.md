# Student Project - Free Code Camp
Build an app that is functionally similar to this: http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV/

## Project Criteria:
* User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.
* User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
* User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
